# Editing Script Presets

You can edit a previously created preset using this option.

After [accessing the script presets menu](/docs/presets/scripts/start), you can select the **edit** option:

<CliMenus.Scripts lang="en" selected="edit" />

Then, choose a preset to edit and you'll see the same creation menu used for presets. Make any changes you need and click `Save`.
