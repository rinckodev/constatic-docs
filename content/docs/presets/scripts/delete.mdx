# Deleting Script Presets

You can delete presets using this option if you no longer need them.

After [accessing the script presets menu](/docs/presets/scripts/start), you can select the **delete** option:

<CliMenus.Scripts lang="en" selected="delete" />

Youâ€™ll be able to select any presets you want to delete. Once selected and confirmed, all files stored for those presets in the CLI will be permanently deleted.
