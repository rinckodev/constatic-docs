# Discord tokens

You can store tokens from discord bot applications in the CLI so you can use them later in other places. For example:

- When [generating a discord bot project](docs/discord/start), if you have saved tokens, an option to choose one of these tokens will be displayed. If you choose one, it will be automatically inserted into the `.env` file
- Select application to manage emojis in [CLI emoji tool](docs/emojis/start)

<Callout type="danger">
    Your tokens are safe! The CLI does not send any information to the internet, all data saved in the CLI stays only on your system. But be careful when using this feature in public cloud environments such as Replit for example, as CLI data is publicly exposed to everyone.
</Callout>

# New token

Select the `New token` option to store an application token. When you enter your application's token, the CLI will search for its information in the Discord API. If it finds it, the token will be stored.

# List tokens

You can list all stored tokens with the `List tokens` option. For security reasons, only the application name will be displayed in the terminal.

# Delete tokens

You can delete saved tokens if you have reset them in the Discord portal or simply no longer want them in the CLI. With the `Delete tokens` option, simply select the tokens you want (pressing `space` to select one or the `A` key to select all) and delete them.
