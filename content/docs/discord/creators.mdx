description: Main base structures for creating commands and systems

import icons from "@/icons";
import { ProjectStructureSrc } from "@/components/docs/ProjectStructure";
import { File, Files, Folder } from "fumadocs-ui/components/files";

On this base, to create commands and systems you must use the creator functions, which are `createCommand`, `createEvent` and `createResponder`.

When executing these functions passing the data of the respective structures, they will be created and registered.

You can set some options in the `index` file of the `discord` folder, see:

```ts title="src/discord/index.ts"
// [!code word:setupCreators]
export const { createCommand, createEvent, createResponder } = setupCreators();
```

This function receives options and returns the creators of commands, events and responders for you to use. By exporting this return you can import them at any time using the base import alias:

```ts
import { createCommand, createEvent, createResponder } from "#base";
```

## Command Options

You can set some command options in the `setupCreators` function:

<Tabs items={["Default permissions", "Guilds", "middleware", "onError", "onNotFound"]}>
  <Tab value="Default permissions">
    Set what the default permissions will be for all commands, if none are defined with the `defaultMemberPermissions` option (It is the same permissions array as the command).

    ```ts
    /* ... */ setupCreators({
        commands: {
            defaultMemberPermissions: ["SendMessages", "Connect"]
        },
    });
    ```
    This way, when you create a command and do not set any default member permissions, what you set in the `setupCreators` function will be the default for all commands.

    ```ts title="command.ts"
    createCommand({
        name: "ping",
        description: "Responde com pong",
        type: ApplicationCommandType.ChatInput,
        // defaultMemberPermissions: [] <-- Not set!
        // But by default it will be registered in the application with ["SendMessages", "Connect"]
        async run(interaction){
            // ...
        }
    })
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Guilds">
    You can set multiple guild IDs that you want to register your bot's commands with the `guilds` option.

    ```ts
    /* ... */ setupCreators({
        commands: {
            guilds: [process.env.MAIN_GUILD_ID, "537817462272557057"]
        },
    });
    ```
    So, instead of registering the commands globally in the application, they will be registered only in the guilds, whose IDs were passed to this option.
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="middleware">
    You can set a `middleware` function that will be executed before the commands` run function

    ```ts
    /* ... */ setupCreators({
        commands: {
            async middleware(interaction){
                console.log("Command executed:", interaction.commandName);
            }
        },
    });
    ```
    You can do a lot with this, such as displaying standardized logs for all executed commands, injecting additional information into the interaction, or even blocking execution based on checks.

    You can call the `block` function to block the execution of commands.

    ```ts
    /* ... */ setupCreators({
        commands: {
            async middleware(interaction, block){
                if (blockedUsers.includes(interaction.user.id)){
                    interaction.reply({ content: "You cannot use any commands!" });
                    block();
                    return;
                }
            }
        },
    });
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="onError">
    It is possible to set a custom error handler for commands with the `onError` function

    ```ts
    /* ... */ setupCreators({
        commands: {
            async onError(error, interaction){
                // ...
            }
        },
    });
    ```
    You can check what type of error it is and choose whether or not to send custom messages.
    
    <Blockquote icon={icons.warn} color="danger">
        It is extremely important to use `await` on Promises when their run is `async`, so that the command error handler can catch it correctly.
    </Blockquote>

    ```ts
    // [!code word:await]
    createCommand({
        name: "ping",
        description: "Replies with pong",
        async run(interaction){
            await interaction.deferReply({ flags: ["Ephemeral"], });

            const data = await dbOperation();

            await interaction.editReply({ content: `Data: ${data.toString()}` });
        }
    })
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="onNotFound">
    If for some reason no handler is found for the command, the `onNotFound` function will be called.

    ```ts
    /* ... */ setupCreators({
        commands: {
            async onNotFound(interaction){
                interaction.reply({ flags: ["Ephemeral"],, 
                    content: "Command not found. Contact the team!"
                });
            }
        },
    });
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Responder Options

You can set some responder options in the `setupCreators` function:

<Tabs items={["middleware", "onError", "onNotFound"]}>
  <Tab value="middleware">
    You can set a `middleware` function that will be executed before the responders` run function

    ```ts
    /* ... */ setupCreators({
        responders: {
            async middleware(interaction, params){
                console.log("Comand executed:", interaction.customId);
                console.log("Params:", params);
            }
        },
    });
    ```
    Just like with commands, you can do a lot with this, such as displaying standardized logs for all executed responders, injecting additional information into the interaction, or even blocking execution based on checks.

    You can run the `block` function to block responders from executing.

    ```ts
    /* ... */ setupCreators({
        responders: {
            async middleware(interaction, _params, block){
                if (interaction.isButton() && blockedUsers.includes(interaction.user.id)){
                    interaction.reply({ content: "You can't click any buttons!" });
                    block();
                    return;
                }
            }
        },
    });
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="onError">
    It is possible to set a custom error handler to respond with the `onError` function.

    ```ts
    /* ... */ setupCreators({
        commands: {
            async onError(error, interaction){
                // ...
            }
        },
    });
    ```
    You can check what type of error it is and choose whether or not to send custom messages.
    
    <Blockquote icon={icons.warn} color="danger">
        It is extremely important to use `await` on Promises when their run is `async`, so that the responder error handler can catch it correctly.
    </Blockquote>

    ```ts
    // [!code word:await]
    createResponder({
        customId: "data/refresh",
        types: [ResponderType.Button], cache: "cached",
        async run(interaction){
            await interaction.deferUpdate();

            const data = await dbOperation();

            await interaction.followUp({ 
                flags: ["Ephemeral"],, content: `Dados: ${data.toString()}` 
            });
        }
    })
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="onNotFound">
    If no handler is found for the component or modal, the `onNotFound` function will be called.

    ```ts
    /* ... */ setupCreators({
        responders: {
            async onNotFound(interaction){
                interaction.reply({ flags: ["Ephemeral"],, 
                    content: "This has not been set up yet. Contact the team!"
                });
            }
        },
    });
    ```
    <Blockquote icon={icons.warn} color="danger">
        Be careful! If you use component collectors or modals in any command, this function will still be called, as it looks for a handler created with the `createResponder` function. So it is important to check if the interaction has already been responded to or wait a short time before actually responding.
