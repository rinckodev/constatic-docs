description: Here's how to troubleshoot some known errors when trying to use the CLI and Constatic Base
---

<Callout type="warn">
    First of all, make sure you meet some requirements to use this project:
    - You need [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/) 20.11 or higher installed (or [Bun](https://bun.sh/))
    - Basic knowledge of programming logic
    - Basic knowledge of [javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/JavaScript) and [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html)
    - Basic knowledge of [discord.js](https://discordjs.guide/)
</Callout>

If you are experiencing any of the errors listed below, here are some solutions you can try:

- [ENOENT: no such file or directory, lstat "C:\Users\...\AppData\Roaming\npm"](/docs/discord/troubleshooting#npmfolder)
- [Script execution has been disabled on this system](/docs/discord/troubleshooting#psscripts)
- [Slash (/) commands do not appear on the server](/docs/discord/troubleshooting#slashnotappear)
- [Used disallowed intents](/docs/discord/troubleshooting#disallowedintents)
- [Cannot find module](/docs/discord/troubleshooting#cannotfindmodule)

## ENOENT: no such file or directory, lstat "C:\Users\...\AppData\Roaming\npm" [#npmfolder]

When trying to run the CLI with the `npx constatic` command, if NodeJs doesn't find the npm folder on your computer, you'll see this error:

<ImageZoom src={"/troubleshooting/npmfolder.svg"} width={1000} height={300} alt="auth" unoptimized />

The solution is as simple as possible, just create the folder, the error itself already indicates the expected location: `C:\Users\YOURUSER\Roaming\npm`

Then navigate to your user's Roaming folder. The easiest way is to open the run command `Win + R`, type `%appdata%` and click OK.

When opening this directory, create a folder called `npm` and that's it!

## Script execution has been disabled on this system [#psscripts]

This occurs when you try to run a powershell script and the script execution policy does not allow it on your system.

Open the start menu and search for `Powershell` (a program like any other), run it to open the powershell terminal and run the command below to change the script execution policy:

```ps
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

Restart the terminal you used to try to run the CLI with `npx constatic` and run it again.

---

## Slash (/) commands do not appear on the server [#slashnotappear]

You started the project, the terminal showed that the commands were registered, but when you try to use them on the server, they do not appear?

Just restart your client (your discord application) to refresh the cache. On your computer, just press the shortcut `CTRL + R` and on your phone, close the application and open it again.

<Callout type="info">
    You can make sure that the commands have been registered in the application by going to the server settings `>` integrations `>` your application and you will see all the commands there.
</Callout>

This happens when the commands are registered in the bot application, if you choose to [register the commands by guild](/docs/discord/creators/#commandoptions), they will be updated instantly.

## Used disallowed intents [#disallowedintents]

If you just started your application in the terminal and received this error from discord, it means that you have not enabled intents in the discord developer portal, [access this mini guide and complete step 4](/docs/discord/guides/application)

---
## Cannot find module [#cannotfindmodule]

This error usually occurs when an import statement does not find the corresponding module, we will talk about two types of modules:

- Internal and external modules: They can be native libraries such as `node:fs`, `node:path` or external ones such as `discord.js`, `chalk`.

- Local modules: Which are files in your project, such as `./index.js`, `../../main.js`, `./functions/math.js`.

If this error occurs displaying the name of a library, you probably misspelled the name or it is not installed as a dependency.

Now if the error is displaying a path to a file, it is very likely that you specified the wrong path or incorrectly.

<Callout type="danger">
    The only valid file paths are relative paths (starting with `.`) or import paths (starting with `#`). If your path does not start with either of these, it is not a valid file path!
</Callout>
