import icons from "@/lib/icons";

## Entry point

The `index.ts` file in the `src` folder is the entry point of this project, it is where the `bootstrap` function is executed to connect the discord bot application.

```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { bootstrap } from "#base";

await bootstrap({ meta: import.meta });
```
In this topic you will see some interesting options for this function.

---

### Meta

This option should receive the import.meta of the current file. When running the project in development, the import.meta directory will be `src`, but when the project is built it will be `build`.
This option is important so that the files in the discord folder can be imported before the bot starts.

### Modules

You can pass an array of [glob patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) relative to the current folder. All files and directories found in this pattern will be imported before the bot starts.

```ts title="src/index.ts"
await bootstrap({ 
    meta: import.meta,
    modules: [
        "./MyCommands/**", 
        "./alt/events", 
        "./tools/**/*.mod.{ts,js}"
    ]
});
```

With this, you can create `commands`, `events`, and `responders` within these directories, and they will be loaded before the bot starts.

<Callout type="info">
You can also load files with _side effects_, allowing you to register global variables, change prototypes of existing objects, and more.
</Callout>

<Callout type="danger">
    But an important warning about this option! Be careful not to specify a pattern that imports everything from the workdir (the current working directory, in development it's the src folder, and in production it's the build folder) or from the `src/discord/base` folder. This will cause circular dependencies and, consequently, crash the project.
    So avoid something like this:

    ```ts title="src/index.ts"
    await bootstrap({
        meta: import.meta,
        modules: [
            "./discord/base/**", // [!code --]
            "./**/*", // [!code --]
            "./", // [!code --]
            "." // [!code --]
        ]
    });
    ```
</Callout>

### Load logs (loadLogs)

It is possible to disable the load logs of structures in this base by setting false in the `loadLogs` option of the `bootstrapApp` function.

```ts title="src/index.ts"
await bootstrap({ 
    meta: import.meta,
    loadLogs: false
});
```

---

### Before load

You can run code before the directories are loaded. Receive the `client` not ready yet.

```ts title="src/index.ts"
await bootstrapApp({ 
    meta: import.meta,
    beforeLoad() {
        console.log(client.application) // null;
        console.log("This happens before the directories are loaded")
    },
});
```
