import icons from "@/icons";
import { ProjectStructureSrc } from "@/components/docs/ProjectStructure";
import { File, Files, Folder } from "fumadocs-ui/components/files";

## Entry point

The `index.ts` file in the `src` folder is the entry point of this project, it is where the `bootstrap` function is executed to connect the discord bot application.

```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { bootstrap } from "#base";

await bootstrap({ meta: import.meta });
```
In this topic you will see some interesting options for this function.

---

### Meta

This option should receive the import.meta of the current file. When running the project in development, the import.meta directory will be `src`, but when the project is built it will be `build`.
This option is important so that the files in the discord folder can be imported before the bot starts.

### Directories

You can pass an array of paths relative to the current folder that you want to be imported before the bot starts.

<Blockquote color="info" icon={icons.info}>
    Any nested subfolders of the directories you pass in this property will also be loaded, no matter how deep.
</Blockquote>

```ts title="src/index.ts"
await bootstrap({
meta: import.meta,
directories: ["./MyCommands", "./alt/events"]
});
```

<Files>
    <ProjectStructureSrc srcFolder={(
        <>
        <Folder name="MyCommands">
            <File name="party.ts" icon={<icons.TbBrandTypescript />} />
            <File name="tell.ts" icon={<icons.TbBrandTypescript />} />
        </Folder>
        <Folder name="alt">
            <Folder name="events">
                <File name="onMemberJoin.ts" icon={<icons.TbBrandTypescript />} />
                <File name="onMemberLeave.ts" icon={<icons.TbBrandTypescript />} />
            </Folder>
        </Folder>
        </>
    )} />
</Files>

With this you can create `commands`, `events` and `responders` within these directories and they will be loaded before the bot starts.

---

### Load logs (loadLogs)

It is possible to disable the load logs of structures in this base by setting false in the `loadLogs` option of the `bootstrapApp` function.

```ts title="src/index.ts"
await bootstrap({ 
    meta: import.meta,
    loadLogs: false
});
```

### When ready (whenReady)

The base already has a listener for the bot's `ready` event, if you don't want to create a new listener for this, you can use it by just passing a function to this option.

```ts title="src/index.ts"
await bootstrap({ 
    meta: import.meta,
    whenReady(client) {
        console.log(`Online as ${client.user.displayName}`)
    },
});
```

---

### Before load

You can run code before the directories are loaded. Receive the `client` not ready yet.

```ts title="src/index.ts"
await bootstrapApp({ 
    meta: import.meta,
    beforeLoad() {
        console.log(client.application) // null;
        console.log("This happens before the directories are loaded")
    },
});
```
