## Folder Structure

If you follow the structure established by this project, it will be very easy to get support anywhere, not to mention that your code will be organized and highly semantic.

Below is an overview of how the project is structured:  

<BaseStructure/>

_All the following folders are located inside `src`_

### Discord Folder
The structures of this base, such as the functions `createCommand`, `createEvent`, and `createResponder`, need to be in a file that is imported before the bot starts. Everything in the `src/discord` folder and its subfolders will be imported before the bot starts, thus loading all the structures.

<Cards>
  <Card
    title="Commands"
    icon={<icons.HiMiniCommandLine/>}
    description="Create all your commands in the src/discord/commands directory"
  />
  <Card
    title="Events"
    icon={<icons.RiCalendarEventFill/>}
    description="Create all your events in the src/discord/events directory"
  />
  <Card
    title="Responders"
    icon={<icons.BsFillReplyFill/>}
    description="Create all your responders in the src/discord/responders directory"
  />
  <Card
    title="Functions"
    icon={<icons.TbMathFunction/>}
    description="Create all your functions in the src/functions directory"
  />
</Cards>
