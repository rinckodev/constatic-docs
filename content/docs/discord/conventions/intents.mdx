description: Discord bot intents using Constatic Base
---

`Intents` were introduced by Discord so that bot developers can choose which events their bot receives based on what data it needs to function. In order for a given event to be emitted, a related intent needs to be enabled.

For example, one of the most used events in Discord bots is `guildMemberAdd`, this event is emitted when a member joins the guild, but it is necessary to set the `GuildMembers` intent for the event to be emitted.

When generating this project, by default all intents are enabled in the `Client`. See below what a simple code would look like without using Constatic Base:

```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { Client } from "discord.js";

const client = new Client({ // [!code word:intents]
    intents: [
        "GuildMembers",
        "MessageContent",
        "Guilds",
        "GuildBans",
        "GuildPresences",
        // ...
    ]
});
```

But it is not necessary to set any intent, because by default, they are all already enabled:

```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { bootstrap } from "#base";

await bootstrap({ meta: import.meta });
```

However, if you want to set only specific intents, as in the case of a public bot where you do not want to enable the `MessageContent` intent, simply use the `intents` property of the `bootstrap` function, it is the same as the `Client` options:

```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { bootstrap } from "#base";

await bootstrap({ // [!code word:intents]
    meta: import.meta,
    intents: [
        "Guilds",
        "GuildWebhooks",
        "GuildBans",
        // ...
    ]    
});
```
