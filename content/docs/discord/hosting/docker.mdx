Docker is an open-source platform that simplifies the creation, testing, and deployment of applications in containers, which are isolated and lightweight environments containing everything needed to run an application, ensuring consistency and portability across different development and production environments.

<Callout type="warn">
    You must have [Docker installed](https://www.docker.com/) and [basic knowledge of Docker.](https://docs.docker.com/guides/) to follow this guide!
</Callout>

Create a `Dockerfile` in the project root with the following contents:

```dockerfile title="Dockerfile"
FROM docker.io/library/node:21.5

WORKDIR /bot

COPY ./package*.json .
RUN npm install

COPY . .

RUN npm run build

CMD [ "npm", "start" ]
```

Create a `.dockerignore` file in the project root with the following contents:

```yml title=".dockerignore"
build
node_modules
```

Then run the command below:
```bash
docker build --pull --rm -f Dockerfile -t discord-bot .
```

<Callout type="info">
    The `-t` flag set a name for the image, in this case it will be **discord-bot**
</Callout>

After that, just run a container with this image.

```bash
docker run -d --name my-bot discord-bot
```
<Callout type="info">
    The `--name` flag set a name for the container, in this case it will be **my-bot**
</Callout>

That's enough, your application will be online in moments.
