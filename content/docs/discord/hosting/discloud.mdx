[Discloud](https://discloud.com/) is a cloud application hosting service.

<Accordions>
    <Accordion title="Make sure the project is built" id="build">
    In order to upload, your project must first be built using the command below:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    </Accordion>
</Accordions>

When generating the project using the [CLI](/docs/discord/start), you can select the `discloud project` feature, which will cause the two files needed to upload your application to the hosting to be included in the project.

<Accordions>
    <Accordion title="But... If you didn't check this option, here's how the files should look">
    Create the `discloud.config` file in the project root.
    ```yml title="discloud.config"
    NAME=Awesome Bot
    TYPE=bot
    MAIN=build/index.js
    RAM=100
    VERSION=latest
    AUTORESTART=false
    START=npm run start
    ```
    Create the `.discloudignore` file in the project root.
    ```yml title=".discloudignore"
    # Folders
    /.vscode
    /src
    /deprecated
    /discloud
    /node_modules

    # Files
    /.env.dev
    /.env.example
    /.eslintrc.json
    /.gitignore
    /tsconfig.json
    /package-lock.json
    /README.md

    # Extensions
    *.md
    *.zip
    *.exe
    *.dev.json
    ```
    </Accordion>
</Accordions>

In the `discloud.config` file you can set a name and an avatar for your application on the hosting if you prefer.
```yml title="discloud.config"
    NAME=My Awesome Bot
    AVATAR=https://i.imgur.com/L7Mxhoj.gif
    # ...
```

    If you don't want to use the Visual Studio Code extension, there are other [ways to host and you can check them out here](https://docs.discloud.com/suporte/hospedar). Just remember to follow the requirements below:
    - The folder that must be sent is `build`, not `src` ([That's why you need to build first](/discord/hosting/discloud#build)).
    - The files and folders that must be sent are `build`, `.env`, `package.json` and `discloud.config`
    - Do not send the `node_modules` folder.
    - It is necessary to set that the script to start is `npm run start`.
