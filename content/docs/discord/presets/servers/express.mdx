The API server preset using ExpressJs comes pre-configured to simplify development. Here's what you need to know to get started:

## Starting the Server

The file containing the code to start the server is located in `src/server/index.ts`. The server will only start after the bot is ready! Therefore, a `ready` event from the bot is used to start the server. See:

```ts title="src/server/index.ts"
import { createEvent, logger } from "#base";
import { env } from "#env";
import express from "express";
import cors from "cors";
import ck from "chalk";
import { registerRoutes } from "./routes/index.js";

const app = express();
app.use(express.json(), cors());

createEvent({
    name: "Start Express Server",
    event: "ready", once: true,
    async run(client) {
        registerRoutes(app, client);

        const port = env.SERVER_PORT ?? 3000;

        app.listen(port, "0.0.0.0", () => {
            logger.log(ck.green(`‚óè ${ck.underline("Express")} server listening on port ${port}`));
        });
    },
});
```

This way, simply import this file in `src/index.ts` and the event will be registered:

```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { bootstrap } from "#base";
import "#server";

await bootstrapApp({ meta: import.meta });
```

The express server will then start immediately after the bot comes online, thus having `Client<true>` (Client instance when already online) to be used in routes.

## Environment Variables

The zod schema for validating the env has been changed to allow new environment variables.

```ts title="src/env.ts"
import { validateEnv } from "#base";
import { z } from "zod";

export const env = validateEnv(z.object({
    BOT_TOKEN: z.string("Discord Bot Token is required").min(1),
    WEBHOOK_LOGS_URL: z.url().optional(),
    SERVER_PORT: z.coerce.number().optional(), // [!code highlight]
}));
```
This means you can change the **port** of the express server using this variable in the `.env` file

```properties title=".env"
BOT_TOKEN=yourtoken
SERVER_PORT=8080
```

## Cors

In this preset, the cors plugin is already installed and has a basic configuration:

```ts title="src/server/index.ts"
import { createEvent, logger } from "#base";
import { env } from "#env";
import express from "express";
import cors from "cors";
import ck from "chalk";
import { registerRoutes } from "./routes/index.js";
// ...

app.use(express.json(), cors()); // [!code highlight]

// ...
```
