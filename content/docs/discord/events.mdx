## Creating functions for event listeners

<Callout type="success">
    You can set some event options in the `setupCreators` function!

    [See more details on the creator functions page](/docs/discord/creators#event-options)
</Callout>

To create a function for a discord event listener, use the `createEvent` function

First import from the base
```ts title="src/events/myevent.ts"
import { createEvent } from "#base";
```

Use the `name` property to create a custom identifier for your event, then set which discord event you expect using the `event` property.
```ts
import { createEvent } from "#base";

createEvent({
    name: "Message edit logs",
    event: "messageUpdate",
    async run(oldMessage, newMessage) {
        console.log("Message edited at:", newMessage.editedAt?.toDateString());
        console.log("Author", newMessage.author?.displayName);
        console.log("Old message content: ", oldMessage.content);
        console.log("New message content:", newMessage.content);   
    }
});
```

All discord events are typed by the `event` property, when you choose an event, the run method will be automatically typed with all the arguments that this event receives.

<Callout type="warn">
    If you create functions for the discord `ready` event, they will only execute after the bot's main ready event, including executions of the main event.

    The `ready` event is automatically set to `once`, so the function is deleted after execution, ensuring a single execution.
